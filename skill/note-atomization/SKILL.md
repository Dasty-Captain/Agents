# Skill: Note Atomization
Use this skill when evaluating whether to split a note or update an existing one.

## Similarity Rules
- **>= 80% Similarity**: Do NOT create a new note. Update the existing note. Append information to the body, update `Parent item`, and establish bidirectional links.
- **< 80% Similarity**: Create a new atomic note in `Permanent Note/`.

## Title Principles (Ray's Protocol)
- Must be a complete sentence (Subject + Predicate).
- Include specific numbers or dates if available.
- No vague words (e.g., "About X", "Thoughts on Y").
- Use keywords optimized for `grep` and semantic search.

## Relationship Mapping
Establish links based on these types:
- **Conceptual**: Hierarchical or thematic.
- **Practical**: Implementation or execution steps.
- **Contrasting**: Counter-arguments or tradeoffs.
- **Source**: Reference the original note as the `Parent item`.
