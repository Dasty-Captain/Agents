# Skill: Semantic Linking
This skill describes the types of connections required to maintain a high-density knowledge graph.

## Link Types to Establish
1. **Conceptual Links**: "What other ideas is this similar to?" (e.g., [[Concept A]])
2. **Practical Links**: "How is this idea applied in a project?" (e.g., [[HD Hyundai Project]])
3. **Contrasting Links**: "What contradicts this idea?" (e.g., [[Alternative View B]])

## Context Retrieval Protocol
- Before finalizing a note, check the `Box/Context/The_Dimension_Company_Vision.md` or similar files to see if the note has strategic alignment.
- Add a `## Strategic Context` section if a strong link is found.
